### Outline
For this project we must create an app called "Roku Flashback". It is a streaming service for movies, shows, and music from the 1950s to the 1990s. The application should  have a parent's (admin) account and a child (regular user) account. Filters such as year and rating should be incorporated. APIs and a CMS are to be used within the app. Social media APIs should also be incorporated.
